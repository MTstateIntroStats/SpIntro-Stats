{\bf {\large On Being Wrong 5\% of the Time}}\vspace{-.6cm}
\end{center}


Our confidence in a 95\% confidence interval comes from the fact that,
in the long run, the technique works 95\% of the time to capture the
unknown parameter.  This leads to an old cheap joke:

{\sf Statisticians are people who require themselves to be wrong 5\%
  of the time.}

We hope that's not really true, but decision making leads to a dilemma:\\
  If you want to never be wrong, you have to always put off decisions
  and collect more data.

Statistics allows us to make decisions based on partial data  while
controlling our error rates.\\
Discuss these situations and decide which error would be worse:\vspace{-.6cm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A criminal jury will make an error if
      they let a guilty defendant go free, or if
      they convict an innocent defendant.
     Which is worse? Why?

\item The doctor gives patients a test designed to detect pancreatic
  cancer (which is usually quite serious).  The test is wrong if:
  it says a healthy patient has cancer (a false positive), or if
  it says a patient with cancer is healthy (a false negative).  Which
  is worse?  Why? 
\begin{students}

\end{students}

\item  An FAA weather forecaster has to decide if it is too dangerous
   (due to storms or potential icing conditions) to allow planes to
   take off.  What is the cost be of grounding a flight? What could
   happen if a flight should have been kept on the ground, but wasn't?

\item  Large chain stores are always looking for locations into which
  they can expand -- perhaps into Bozeman. 
  When would a  decision to open a store in Bozeman  be wrong?\\
  When would a decision to not open a store in Bozeman  be
  wrong?\\
  What are the trade-offs?

{\bf Two Types of Error. }

Definitions:\vspace{-.6cm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item To reject $H_0$ when it is true is called a Type I error.
  \item To fail to reject $H_0$ when it is false is called a Type II error.
\vspace{-.6cm}
\end{itemize}
To remember which is which: we start a hypothesis test by assuming
$H_0$ is true, so Type I goes with $H_0$ being true. 

This table also helps us stay organized: \hfill
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\hline
   & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Decision:} \\
$H_0$ is:  & Reject $H_0$ & Do not reject $H_0$\\\hline
true & {\em Type I Error} & Correct  \\ \hline
false& Correct & {\em Type II error}   \\ \hline\hline
\end{tabular}



{\bf Which is worse?}

The setup for hypothesis testing assumes that we really need to
control the rate of Type I error.  We can do this by setting our
 significance level, $\alpha$.  If, for example, $\alpha = 0.01$, then
 when we reject $H_0$ we are making an error less than 1\% of the time.
So $\alpha$ is the probability of making an error when $H_0$ is true.

There is also a symbol for the probability of a Type II error,
$\beta$, but it changes depending on which alternative parameter
value is correct. Instead of focusing on the negative (error), we
more often talk about the {\bf power} of a test to detect an effect
which is really present.  Power = $1-\beta$ is the probability of
rejecting $H_0$ when it is false (that's a good thing, so we want
power to be high). 



\begin{center}
  {\bf Justice System and Errors }
\end{center}

In both the justice system and in statistics, we can make errors. In
statistics the only way to avoid making errors is to not state any
conclusion without measuring or polling the entire population.  That's
expensive and time consuming, so we instead try to control the chances
of making an error.  
 

For a scientist, committing a Type I error means we could report a
big discovery when in fact, nothing is going on. (How embarrassing!)
This is considered to be more critical than a Type II error, which happens if
the scientist does a research project and finds no ``effect'' when, in
fact, there is one. Type I error rate is controlled by setting
$\alpha$, the significance level, and only rejecting $H_0$ when the
p-value is less than $\alpha$. 


Type II error is harder to control because it depends on these things:
\vspace{-.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Sample size.  P--values are strongly affected by sample
  size. With a big sample we can detect small differences.  With small
  samples, only coarse or obvious ones.
\item  Significance level.  The fence, or $\alpha$ (alpha), is
  usually set at .10, .05 or .01 with smaller values requiring
  stronger evidence before we reject the null hypothesis and thus
  lower probability of error.  
\item  The null hypothesis has to be wrong, but it could be wrong just
  by a small amount or by a large amount.  For example if 
   we did not reject the null hypothesis that treatment and
  control  were equally effective,  we could be making a type II
  error.  If in fact, if there was a small difference, it would be
  hard to detect, and if the treatment was far better, it would
  be easy to detect.  This is called the effect size, which is
  [difference between null model mean and an alternative mean] divided
  by standard error.

  {\bf Take Home Message} \vspace{-.6cm}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Errors happen.  Use of statistics does not prevent all errors,
    but it does limit them to a level we can tolerate. We have labels
    for two types of error.
  \item The talk about probability of  error is based on the sampling
    distribution assuming random assignment of treatments or random
    sampling. It's really a ``best case'' scenario, because there
    could be other sources of error we have not considered.  For
    example, we could have not sampled from some part of the
    population, or we could have errors in our measuring tools.
  \item If you are designing a study, you might need to consult a
    statistician to help determine how large a sample size is
    needed. You'll need to decide what $\alpha$ to use, what the
    underlying variation is ($\sigma$), and how large a difference you
    need to detect with a certain level of power.
