### Repo of Course materials for Stat 216, 2015--2016 ###
#### at Montana State University 

 Three units  
 Our sequencing follows the lead of Nathan Tintle and the authors of [_Introduction to Statistical Investigations_](http://math.hope.edu/isi/)  
Unit 1   
 - Brief review of statistical summaries and plots  
 - Hypothesis Testing of one proportion  
 - Bootstrap confidence interval of one proportion  
Unit 2   
 - Hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimate of the difference in two proportions  
 - Hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimate of the difference in two means    
 - Hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimate of a single mean  
 - Hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimate of a slope or correlation  
Unit 3   
 - Use of "z" procedures to test and estimate one proportion  
 - Use of "z" procedures to test and estimate the difference between two proportions    
 - Use of "t" procedures to test and estimate one mean      
 - Use of "t" procedures to test and estimate the difference between two means    

Throughout, the course we emphasize interpretation of statistical concepts and discuss the "scope of inference" for our conclusions.  



### LaTeX code requires a full LaTeX setup ###

* Packages:  
  letterpaper, amsmath, amssymb, graphicx, ifthen, comment, natbib, color, fancyhdr, hyperref, pdflatex

* To build the pdf file, you should cd to coursePack directory and run   
  pdflatex coursePack.tex  

  The coursePack file automatically includes the files it needs like U1-D1.tex for unit 1, day 1, on down to U3-D28.tex.  

### Known issues:  
  We have developed these activities over the last two years at MSU and have used them extensively in Stat216 (Intro Stats) meeting twice a week for 75 minutes each time.  This fall we are also using them in the same class with a different schedule: meeting MWF for 50 minutes each. We expect some issues at getting them to fit.  In fact, the original activities do not all fit well in the 75 minute classes as well.  One purpose of this repository is to provide a discussion platform to discuss what work, what doesn't, and how these could be improved.  

### Companion site:  
  We have written our own web apps which are used in most of these activities.
